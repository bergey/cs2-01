To warm up to Processing again, here is a small program to modify.  Make as many of the following changes as you have time.  I've tried to list them in order of increasing difficulty.

* Change the color of the ball
* Change the size of the ball
* Change the strength of "gravity"
* Increase the number of previous locations drawn
* Draw only the current location
* Instead of one ball, make 3 independant balls, each with different position, velocity
* Increase the number of balls to 10 (use an array, if you didn't already in the previous)
* draw each ball a different size
* draw each ball a different color
* start the balls at random locations, with random velocities (within reasonable bounds)
* add a method to *Ball* that calculates the total energy (kinetic + potential)
* each time a ball is drawn, print it's current energy to the console
